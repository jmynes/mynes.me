        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>
          I recenetly graduated with a Bachelor's in Information Technology & Management (ITM) from Illinois Institute of Technology. One of my areas of focus was mobile-first responsive web design, and this was the first site I associated a domain name with! Most of my pages are just demos, and can be accessed at <a href="http://www.mynes.me/samples">(Currently under construction, but useable.)</a> My first designed web page that goes beyond a demo or personal use is in use by the <a href="http://www.vpc5.nerdcore.co/">Vocalist Producer Challenge V</a>, an annual Nerdcore music contest for prize money and glory.

        <p>
          One of the primary reasons for my interest in Linux and Bitcoin is my love for the FOSS (Free Open Source Software) community. I'm relatively new to <a href="https://github.com/jmynes">Github submissions</a>, but I'm no stranger to browsing and downloading from other repositories.

          I've run <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nerdynonsense/">Nerdy Nonsense & Friends</a> on <a href="tunein.com/radio/WIIT-889-s29558">WIIT 88.9FM Chicago</a> @ Illinois Tech in various formats for about three years. I primarily spin <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/11/30/nerdcore-hip-hop-feature/">Nerdcore Hip-Hop</a>, though I used to have a co-host David sobel who was my connect for sweet <a href="http://www.chiptune.com">Chiptunes/VGM</a>. When my co-host left for his own show, I switched it up and now have a segment called Wordy Nonsense where a friend, guest, Uber driver, or anyone else I find interesting gets to play their favorite music for an hour and chat live on FM. It's a two hour broadcast, currently 10PM-12AM on Friday nights when it fits my schedule.

           I've been meaning to post every show recording somewhere, but the link above is a very old weekly Mixcloud upload of David and myself on Nerdy Nonsense: Remixed. We even hosted a concert at The Bog (IIT venue) with the bands <a href="https://souporvillainz.bandcamp.com/">Soup or Villainz</a> and <a href="https://1ups.bandcamp.com/">1-UP Creative Mindframe</a>, with free admission. This was co-hosted by my organization bIITcoin Chicago. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/nerdy-nonsense-remixed/id1088519600?l=en">Our old stuff is even on iTunes!</a>

        <p>
          I'm a GNU/Linux hobbyist, and have used it as my daily driver since 2012. I enjoy dual or triple booting nearly every device I own, down to my phone, when possible. I got sick of Ubuntu early on and moved on to Crunchbang Debian (which is unfortunately now dead, though forked as <a href="https://crunchbangplusplus.org/">Crunchbang Plus Plus</a>), drawn by its simplicity and low system requirements. When Crunchbang died I moved on to Arch Linux, which I presently use with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/2lol86/openboxconkytint2_some_clever_title_to_make_you/"> these configurations</a> that I found on Reddit.
